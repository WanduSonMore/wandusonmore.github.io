                The Endless House is a first person horror game where you play as a young half black woman named Heather Shields, 
                who is attending college in the year 1984 she is good at history, archery, and her dad taught her how to shoot. 
                After a long year Heather has finished up this years class and celebrates it with two of her friends, Aaron and Jackson.
                They were all into stuff about ghosts and haunted places, 
                so they decide to celebrate the end of term by checking out an old abandon manor house that Jackson heard about, 
                but after getting there and spending some time in the manor it becomes very clear that there is something far more sinister going on in this house than just your average haunting.
                When trying to leave the house they find the door they come though gone and they are attack by monsters and insane people.
                After being seperated from her friends she is saved by a man named Noah Becker, 
                who had been studying the anomolies in the house with his now deceased partner. 
                He had been in the house for six months and has been trying to stop the evil entity that controls this endless building.
                With the help of Noah, Heather is then tasked with destroy three condoits that give the house power and allow manipulate reality within the house, 
                which helps the house keep anyone who comes into the building trapped in it and prevents them from finding and destroying the object or heart that gives it life.
                Only by destroying these condoits can Heather and Noah gain access to the houses heart and destroy it, 
                which would allow them to go free.
