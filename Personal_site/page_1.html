            <h2>Summary:</h2>
            <p>
                Visions of Murder is a first person horror game where you play as detective Steven Kirkman, a gruff man in his early thirties.
                Kirkman has taken on a case involving a series of strange murders and the police have not found anyway to track down the murder. 
                Previously Kirkman had taken on a case that ended in a innocent person dying that haunted him and his dreams. 
                After taking on this new case his nightmares start showing things in current case.
                In the dreams Kirkman sees through the eyes of the victims in the murders and witness them being murdered by some sort of supernatural entity.
                At first Kirkman believes that they are just dreams, 
                but when his dreams start predicting showing how the murders are being commited before the body is found, 
                he realizes there is more to these than he thought.
                Using his dreams as his guide he tries to stop the murder, 
                he realizes that he may be involved in some sort of conflict between two powerful entities.
                One being the murder and the other being the entity who is giving him these visions in order to stop the first.
                Will Kirkman be able to stop this supernatural murder or will he die like the victims in his dreams?
